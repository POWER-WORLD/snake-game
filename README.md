<h1>🐍 Snake Game-</h1>
A fun and interactive Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This classic game lets you control a snake, collect food, and grow longer while avoiding collisions with yourself and the game boundaries.<b2>
This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, and game logic implementation with pure web technologies.

<h3>🎮 How to Play-</h3>
Use Arrow Keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to control the snake's direction.<br>
Eat the food (dots) to grow longer.<br>
Avoid colliding with your own body or the walls — or it’s game over!.<br>
Try to score as high as possible before the snake crashes!.<br>

<h3>✨ Features-</h3>
✅ Real-Time Snake Movement<br>
✅ Score Tracking<br>
✅ Random Food Placement<br>
✅ Game Over Detection<br>
✅ Responsive and Clean Layout<br>
✅ Restart Option (reload to play again)<br>
✅ Vanilla JavaScript Implementation (No libraries)<br>

<h3>🛠️ Technologies Used-</h3>
HTML5 — for creating the game structure and canvas<br>
CSS3 — for styling the game area and layout<br>
JavaScript (Vanilla) — for game logic, user input, score tracking, and real-time updates<br>
